title: "Serial dictator program (Julia)"
---

I wrote this program to help with assigning papers to reviewers for a peer review group I helped start.

To use it, just upload a CSV with column names that are the names of individuals.
For example, the data for a 3-person, 3-object setting should look like

| Adam                 | Bob                 | Candace                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Adam's first choice  | Bob's first choice  | Candace's first choice  |
| Adam's second choice | Bob's second choice | Candace's second choice |
| Adam's third choice  | Bob's third choice  | Candace's third choice  |

The program is written in the wonderful [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language, but I am more than happy to write similar programs in other languages (most easily in R or Stata) if there is a demand!

The serial dictator mechanism is used.
To illustrate, assume there are three papers to be assigned $\{a,b,c\}$ and three potential reviewers $\{1,2,3\}$.
Reviewer $i$'s preferences are denoted by $P_i$.
For this example, I'll use the following preferences:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
  P_1: & a - b - c \\
  P_2: & a - c - b \\
  P_3: & b - a - c
\end{array}
$$

To get the best possible allocation, the allocator wants to consider consider all possible orders of dictatorship.
With three potential reviewers, these are:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
  \text{order 1}: & 1 \to 2 \to 3 \\
  \text{order 2}: & 1 \to 3 \to 2 \\
  \text{order 3}: & 2 \to 1 \to 3 \\
  \text{order 4}: & 2 \to 3 \to 1 \\
  \text{order 5}: & 3 \to 1 \to 2 \\
  \text{order 6}: & 3 \to 2 \to 1
\end{array}
$$

I'll illustrate with order 1.
The allocation for dictator order 1 for individual $i$ is denoted $\mu_1(i)$.

1. Define the set of available objects as $A_1 = \{1,2,3\}$
1. Person 1 chooses first. All objects are in the available set, so she gets her most preferred item. So, $\mu_1(1) = a$. Update the set of available objects to be $A_2 = A_1 \setminus \{\mu_1(1)\}$.
1. Person 2 chooses her most preferred item from the set of available objects, $A_2$. Her most preferred item is not available, so she gets her second-most preferred item. So, $\mu_1(2) = c$. Update the set of available objects to be $A_3 = A_2 \setminus \{\mu_1(1), \mu_1(2)\}$.
1. There is only one item available, so the third person is assigned that item. So $\mu_1(3) = b$.

The final allocation for dictator order 1 is $\mu = (a,c,b)$.
How well of are the people under this allocation?
A simple way to calculate welfare is to subtract 4 from the ranking of the allocation.
Let $P_i(\mu_1)$ be the ranking of person $i$'s allocated object, their payoff is then $4 - P_i(\mu_1)$.
The total welfare of the allocation for serial dictator order $k$ is
\[V_k = \sum_{i=1}^3 \left(4 - P_i(\mu_k)\right).\]
The payoff to order 1, then, is 5.
